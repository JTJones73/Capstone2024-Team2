## Functionality
The Launching and Firing subsystem is the system that will fire the intercepting round when given a signal from the aiming subsystem. This system will also preload the launching apparatus so that each round may fire with minimum delay. This subsystem will use a 12-volt DC brushed motor along with a relay that will use the signal from the aiming subsystem as an input to operate the DC motor. 

## Specifications and Restraints
| Number | Constraint | Constraint description | Origin |
|------|--------------------|------------------------|------------|
| 1. | NEC 310.15(B) | The  Launching and Firing subsystem shall use appropriate wiring for all connections within the subsystem as according to the ampacity limits listed in the NEC 310.15(B) table | NEC 310.15(B) |
| 2. | Fire without human interaction | The Launching and Firing subsystem shall fire without any human interaction with the field of play or the launching apparatus itself | DEVCOM competition rulebook |
| 3. | Fit within a cubic foot of space | The Launching and Firing subsystem is required to fit within a cubic foot of space (1 ft by 1 ft by 1 ft) along with the other subsystems that will be placed within that space | DEVCOM competition rulebook |
| 4. | Safe operating | The Launching and Firing subsystem shall comply with the DEVCOM safety constaints given in the DEVCOM rulebook | DEVCOM competition rulebook |
| 5. |  Signal-to-Fire delay | The Launching and Firing subsystem shall fire a round within XX ms after receiving the signal from the aiming subsystem. This is the amount of time left after accounting for all other subsystems to complete their processes during the worst case scenario. | Team Specification |
| 6. | Preloading after firing | The Launching and Firing subsystem will reset the preload condition after each round is fired. | Team Specification | 
| 7. | Motor Shaft Type | The Launching and Firing subsyetm shall use a motor that has an X type output shaft. | Mechanical Engineering Team Specification |
| 8. | Motor Torque | The Launching and Firing Mechanism shall operate firing mechanism on the launcher apparatus | Mechanical Engineering Team Specification |
| 9. | Motor Length | The motor used for the Firing apparatus shall not exceed 3 inches in length. This was a given constraint from the ME team | Mechanical Engineering Team Specification |
